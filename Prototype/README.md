# @kashima/prototype
> :dart: **| Prototype version of Kashima**

## Why?
:warning: **TL;DR This is kinda like a reference template of what the beta product will look/function like.**

At the moment (3/1/2020 at 23:41) the Desktop app (closed source) is getting out of hand as of how we want to build it, so this is a basic music player to show what we're trying to create. We are using placeholder stylesheets from W3 Schools (all credits to them!) and will not be in the beta build. This prototype will include [Matsuwa](https://github.com/kashima-org/prototype/tree/master/src/commons/matsuwa), our helper for creating skins/plugins and extra utilities to help in the process of creating amazing plugins and skins. It introduces a new helper called [Event Dispatcher](https://github.com/kashima-org/prototype/tree/master/src/commons/event-dispatcher) is to help "dispatch" events from different plugins or components.

This repository will be archived when we present the demo to our users, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kashima_org) to get more information!

# Contributions
Thanks on contributing to Kashima's Gateway server! It's always a pleasure of getting feedback of what we are doing wrong. Read below on how to contribute and be on the [contributors](https://kashima.app/contributors) page!

## Setup
Before we get started, you must have **TypeScript** and **ESLint** installed globally on your machine. You can install them with ``npm i -g eslint typescript``

- Fork the repository [here](https://github.com/kashima-org/gateway/fork)
- Clone the repository to your local machine (``git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/docs``)
- Change the directory to the cloned repo (``cd gateway``) and create a seperate branch (``git checkout -b <branch>``)
- Install any local dependencies from NPM (``npm i``)
- Update the codebase to what you want to contribute!
  - Run ``npm run build`` to lint the repository and compile TypeScript to check for errors
- Then, submit your [pull request](https://github.com/kashima-org/gateway/compare) and wait a few minutes or a few hours for the maintainers to look at your Pull Request and ask for any changes or it'll be merged.
